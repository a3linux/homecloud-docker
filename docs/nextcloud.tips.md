Nextcloud Tips
================

Q: How to remove reset password link?

Set the "lost_password_link" to "disabled" as

```
docker exec -it -u www-data homecloud_nextcloudapp php occ config:system:set lost_password_link --value="disabled"
```

Q: Set the default_phone_region?

```
docker exec -it -u www-data homecloud_nextcloudapp php occ config:system:set default_phone_region --value="SG"
```

This sets the default region for phone numbers on your Nextcloud server, using ISO 3166-1 country codes such as DE for Germany, FR for France, â€¦ It is required to allow inserting phone numbers in the user profiles starting without the country code (e.g. +49 for Germany).

This command will scan all user's files,
```
docker exec -it -u www-data homecloud_nextcloudapp php occ files:scan user_id
```

Q: How to do the groupfolder files scan?

This command scan the full groupfolder, please be noticed, groupfolder named as index, 1, 2, 3 ...

```

```

Q: How to disable the auto generated contacts call "Recently Contacted" in Contacts app? 
This is more like a Groupware function introduced by Nextcloud Groupware Bundle apps. According to the discussion [here](https://community.e.foundation/t/delete-recently-contacted/38555/3), disable the Nextcloud App contactsinteraction can disable the "Recently Contacted" in Contacts display.

There is no very careful or detail document about this yet.

```
docker exec -it -u www-data homecloud_nextcloudapp php /var/www/html/occ app:disable contactsinteraction
```
