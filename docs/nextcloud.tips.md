Q: How to reset all generated preview

WARNING: This is not supported but it has been confirmed to work by multiple users. Proceed at your own risk. Always keep backups around.

1. Remove the folder **your-nextcloud-data-directory/appdata_xxxxxxxx/preview**
2. Optional: change parameters preview_max_x and preview_max_y in config.php (e.g., to 512), and change the previewgenerator app parameters heightSizes, squareSizes and widthSizes as per the README (or better yet, to a low value each, e.g. 512, 256 and 512 respectively)
3. Run, this will reset generated previews in the database
```
occ files:scan-app-data 
```
4. Run, this will run very fast if you did step 2
```
occ preview:generate-all [user-id]
```

This is not official supported now, but there are lot of discussions online and practices from community.
